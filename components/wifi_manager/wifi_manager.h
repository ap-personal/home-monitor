/**
 * @file wifi_manager.h
 * @brief WiFi Connection Manager and IoT Data Transmission System
 * 
 * This module provides comprehensive WiFi connectivity management and HTTP-based
 * data transmission capabilities for ESP32-based IoT applications. It abstracts
 * the complexity of WiFi connection handling, network error recovery, and remote
 * data transmission into a simple, reliable API.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Automatic WiFi connection with configurable retry logic
 * - Real-time connection status monitoring and signal strength reporting
 * - JSON-formatted HTTP POST transmission for IoT platforms
 * - Robust error handling with graceful degradation
 * - Non-blocking operation design for embedded applications
 * - Easy integration with sensor data collection systems
 * 
 * Configuration:
 * WiFi network credentials and HTTP server settings are configured in wifi_config.h
 * This separation allows easy customization without modifying core functionality.
 * 
 * Supported Use Cases:
 * - Sensor data transmission to cloud platforms (AWS IoT, Google Cloud, etc.)
 * - Local server communication for home automation systems
 * - Webhook integration with services like Zapier, IFTTT
 * - Custom REST API endpoints for data collection
 * 
 * Network Resilience:
 * The manager handles network interruptions gracefully, automatically attempting
 * reconnection without disrupting the main application flow. Failed transmissions
 * are reported but do not block system operation.

 * @author ESP32 Development Team
 * @version 1.0

 * @brief Initialize WiFi communication subsystem
 * 
 * Performs complete initialization of the WiFi stack including NVS storage setup,

 * 
 * Initialization Process:
 * 1. Initialize NVS (Non-Volatile Storage) for WiFi configuration persistence
 * 2. Set up TCP/IP network interface and event loop
 * 3. Configure WiFi driver with optimized settings
 * 4. Register event handlers for connection state management
 * 5. Configure station mode with provided credentials
 * 
 * Configuration Source:
 * WiFi credentials (SSID, password) and security settings are loaded from
 * wifi_config.h. Modify that file to update network settings.
 * 
 * Error Conditions:
 * - NVS initialization failure (corrupted flash, insufficient space)
 * - Network interface setup failure (driver issues, memory constraints)
 * - Event handler registration failure (system resource exhaustion)
 * 
 * @return ESP_OK if initialization completed successfully

 * 2. Initiate connection attempt to target network
 * 3. Wait for connection establishment or timeout
 * 4. Retry on failure up to configured maximum attempts
 * 5. Update internal connection status based on result

 * Retry Strategy:
 * - Maximum retry attempts: Defined by WIFI_RETRY_COUNT in wifi_config.h
 * - Retry delay: Progressive delay between attempts for network stability
 * - Automatic status updates: Internal state machine tracks progress

 * Blocking Behavior:
 * This function blocks until either successful connection or final failure.

/**

 * @brief ESP32 Environmental Monitor - Application Entry Point
 * 
 * This file contains the main appl    ESP_LOGI(TAG, "✓ WiFi transmission: 30-second intervals");cation entry point for the ESP32-based
 * environmental monitoring system. Following clean architecture principles,
 * this main function delegates all functionality to the system manager,
 * keeping the entry point minimal and focused solely on high-level coordination.
 * 
 * System Overview:
 * The ESP32 Environmental Monitor is a comprehensive IoT sensor system that:
 * - Continuously monitors temperature and humidity using DHT11 sensor
 * - Displays real-time data on a 240x240 ST7789 TFT display
 * - Transmits data to remote servers via WiFi connectivity
 * - Operates reliably with graceful error handling and recovery
 * 
 * Architecture Philosophy:
 * This implementation follows component-based architecture where:
 * - Each hardware component has its own dedicated driver module
 * - System manager coordinates all components and application logic
 * - Main function serves only as a thin initialization layer
 * - All business logic is encapsulated in appropriate modules
 * 
 * Component Structure:
 * - ST7789 Display Driver: High-speed TFT display management
 * - DHT11 Sensor Driver: Temperature/humidity data acquisition
 * - WiFi Manager: Network connectivity and data transmission
 * - System Manager: Application coordination and task management
 * - Pinout Manager: Centralized GPIO pin configuration

/**
 * @brief Main application entry point and system coordinator
 * 
 * This function serves as the primary entry point for the ESP32 Environmental
 * Monitor application. It implements a clean, minimal initialization sequence
 * that delegates all complex functionality to the system manager component.
 * 
 * Execution Flow:
 * 1. Display system identification and version information
 * 2. Initialize all hardware components via system manager
 * 3. Start continuous monitoring operations
 * 4. Handle any critical initialization failures
 * 
 * Design Philosophy:
 * The main function is intentionally kept minimal to:
 * - Provide clear separation between application entry and business logic
 * - Simplify testing and modular development
 * - Enable easy system reconfiguration without touching main application
 * - Follow single responsibility principle (main = coordination only)
 * 
 * Error Handling Strategy:
 * - System initialization failures are treated as critical errors
 * - Failed startup prevents system operation to avoid undefined behavior
 * - All error conditions are logged with descriptive messages
 * - Clean error reporting enables effective debugging
 * 
 * Resource Management:
 * - No dynamic memory allocation in main function
 * - All resource management delegated to appropriate component modules
 * - System manager handles task creation and lifecycle management
 * - Clean separation allows for proper resource cleanup during shutdown
 * 
 * @note This function never returns during normal operation
 * @note All hardware initialization is handled by system_init()
 * @note Continuous operation is managed by system_start()
 * @see system_manager.h for detailed system management API
